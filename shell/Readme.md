This repository contains the code for the Shell (shellFinal.py). The
purpose is to have a fairly simple shell that runs bash.

`$ ./shellFinal.py`
* Is a final verion of my shell
* Runs single commands with possible parameters
* Commands with single pipes
* Commands with redirects in/out

redirect.py is my redirect code from previous week. shell.py is a shell that I previously made that doesn't work as well.
